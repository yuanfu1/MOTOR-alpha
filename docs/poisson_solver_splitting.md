# Advantages of Splitting Poisson Solver

## Overview
The splitting method decomposes the Poisson problem with non-zero boundary conditions into two separate problems:
1. Zero-Dirichlet problem
2. Harmonic function construction

## Key Advantages

### 1. Numerical Benefits
- Better conditioning of each sub-problem
- Reduced numerical errors at boundaries
- Improved convergence rates for iterative methods

### 2. Algorithmic Flexibility
- Zero-Dirichlet solver can use optimized methods (multigrid, FFT)
- Harmonic function can be constructed using specialized techniques
- Each component can be optimized independently

### 3. Implementation Benefits
- Modular code structure
- Easier testing and verification
- Reusable components for other problems

### 4. Mathematical Properties
- Clear separation of homogeneous and non-homogeneous parts
- Better theoretical understanding of error sources
- Simplified error analysis

## Mathematical Formulation
```
Original:    ∇²u = f  with  u = g on boundary
Split into:
1. ∇²v = f  with  v = 0 on boundary
2. ∇²h = 0  with  h = g on boundary
Solution:    u = v + h
```
