                  Armijo backtracking line search, solved on a sequence of finer grids and higher
                  frequencies to remain in the vicinity of the global optimum, inexactly terminated
                  to prevent oversolving, preconditioned by L-BFGS/Frankel, regularized by a total
                  variation operator to capture sharp interfaces, finely discretized by finite
                  elements in the Lam\'{e} parameter space to provide flexibility and avoid bias,
                  implemented in matrix-free fashion with adjoint-based computation of reduced
                  gradient and reduced Hessian-vector products, checkpointed to avoid full spacetime

                  solutions of the forward and adjoint wave equations and the evaluation of
                  gradient-like information. Several numerical examples demonstrate the grid
                  independence of linear and nonlinear iterations, the effectiveness of the

                  inversion parameters on up to 2048 processors, the effectiveness of multiscale

                  and the ability to fit the observational data while reconstructing the model with

                  derivation of the analytic flux Jacobian can become quite complicated depending on
                  the complexity of the numerical flux calculation. Practically, the derivation of
                  the exact Jacobian by hand is an unrealistic option because of the enormous
                  man-hour investment needed. In this work, automatic differentiation is used to
                  evaluate the exact Jacobian of upwind schemes implemented in the flow solver
                  QUADFLOW. We compare the use of exact Jacobians and Jacobians numerically
                  approximated by first-order forward differences. For a two-dimensional airfoil
                  under three different flight conditions (quasi-incompressible flow, compressible
                  subsonic flow, and transonic flow), we show that the robustness and performance of
                  the present finite volume scheme is significantly improved by using exact

  abstract      = {The parallel construction of maximal independent sets is a useful building block
                  for many algorithms in the computational sciences, including graph coloring and
                  multigrid coarse grid creation on unstructured meshes. We present an efficient
                  asynchronous maximal independent set algorithm for use on parallel computers, for
                  ``well partitioned'' graphs, that arise from finite element (FE) models. For
                  appropriately partitioned bounded degree graphs, it is shown that the running time
                  of our algorithm under the P-RAM computational model is of $O(1)$, which is an
                  improvement over the previous best P-RAM complexity for this class of graphs. We
                  present numerical experiments on an IBM SP, that confirm our P-RAM complexity
                  model is indicative of the performance one can expect with practical partitions on
                  graphs from FE problems.},

  abstract      = {In the numerical simulation of atmospheric transport-chemistry processes, a major
                  task is the integration of the stiff systems of ordinary differential equations
                  describing the chemical transformations. It is therefore of interest to
                  systematically search for stiff solvers which can be identified as close to
                  optimal for atmospheric applications. In this paper we continue our investigation
                  from Sandu et al. (1996, CWI Report NM-R9603 and Report in Comput. Math., No. 85)
                  and compare eight solvers on a set of seven box-models used in present day models.
                  The focus is on Rosenbrock solvers. These turn out to be very well suited for our
                  application when they are provided with highly efficient sparse matrix techniques
                  to economize on the linear algebra. Two of the Rosenbrock solvers tested are from
                  the literature, viz. and 4, and two are new and specially developed for air
                  quality applications, viz. 3 and 3. }

  abstract      = {{Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented
                  development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in
                  software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing
                  objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The
                  book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance
                  can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a
                  tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern
                  that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for
                  virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered
                  object-oriented designs.} {Now on CD, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is
                  more valuable than ever!

                  Use the contents of the CD to create your own design documents and reusable
                  components. The CD contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own
                  design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete
                  Design Patterns content in standard HTML format, with numerous hyperlinked
                  cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic
                  search mechanism, enhancing online search capabilities; graphical user environment,
                  allowing ease of navigation.

                  First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design
                  presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems.
                  Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have
                  become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented
                  software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are
                  now available on CD-ROM. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables
                  programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an
                  online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software.

                  The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the
                  design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog
                  recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from
                  real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented
                  in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who
                  already own the book will want the CD to take advantage of its dynamic search
                  mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.}},

                  importance in modern physics--such as in gauge theory. This book, a succinct
                  introduction to the subject by renown mathematician Norman Steenrod, was the first
                  to present the subject systematically.

                  It begins with a general introduction to bundles, including such topics as
                  differentiable manifolds and covering spaces. The author then provides brief
                  surveys of advanced topics, such as homotopy theory and cohomology theory, before
                  using them to study further properties of fibre bundles. The result is a classic
                  and timeless work of great utility that will appeal to serious mathematicians and
                  theoretical physicists alike. }},

  abstract      = {For non-M-matrices, this paper proposes an unstructured multigrid method that
                  only attempts to interpolate in the directions of geometrical smoothness. These
                  directions are determined by analyzing samples of algebraically smooth error, e.
                  Neighboring grid points i and j are called smoothly coupled if e i and e j are
                  consistently nearby in value. In addition, these dierences may be used to dene
                  interpolation weights. These new ideas may be incorporated into the algebraic
                  multigrid method. Test results show that the new method can have much lower grid
                  and operator complexities compared to AMG, leading to lower solve timings. 1 },

  abstract      = {We consider multiphysics applications from algorithmic and architectural
                  perspectives, where ``algorithmic'' includes both mathematical analysis and
                  computational complexity and ``architectural'' includes both software and hardware
                  environments. Many diverse multiphysics applications can be reduced, en route to
                  their computational simulation, to a common algebraic coupling paradigm.
                  Mathematical analysis of multiphysics coupling in this form is not always
                  practical for realistic applications, but model problems representative of
                  applications discussed herein can provide insight. A variety of software
                  frameworks for multiphysics applications have been constructed and refined within
                  disciplinary communities and executed on leading-edge computer systems. We examine
                  several of these, expose some commonalities among them, and attempt to extrapolate
                  best practices to future systems. From our study, we summarize challenges and
                  forecast opportunities.}

                  incompatibilities between off-the-shelf optimization software and application
                  software. The Hilbert Class Library (HCL) defines the fundamental mathematical
                  objects arising in optimization problems, such as vectors, linear operators, and
                  so forth, as C++ classes, making it possible to write optimization code in a
                  natural fashion, while allowing application software such as simulators to use the
                  most convenient data structures and programming style. In spite of the poor
                  reputation C++ has for runtime performance, the use of mixed-language programming
                  allows performance equal to that achieved by standard Fortran packages, as
                  comparisons with the popular code LBFGS and ARPACK demonstrate.},
