# PETSc Developers Communication Channels

## GitLab

Day-to-day development happens at the [PETSc GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc).
There, you can find the history and development version of the source code,
[see or create issues](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/issues),
[see or create merge requests](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/merge_requests),
and more.

## Mailing Lists

Joining the {ref}`mailing lists <doc_mail>` and [PETSc on Discord](https://discord.gg/Fqm8r6Gcyb).

Comments and questions regarding PETSc design and development should go to <mailto:petsc-dev@mcs.anl.gov>.

Configuration issues (with `make.log` and `configure.log` attached) should be reported to <mailto:petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov>.

For bugs and other issues, we encourage developers to create a [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) account and
[file issues directly](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/issues);
this allows better tracking of long-term bug reports and feature requests.

General questions regarding the use of PETSc can, as usual, go to <mailto:petsc-users@mcs.anl.gov> (public)
or <mailto:petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov> (private, can handle large attachments).

## Responding to User Requests and Questions

PETSc users communicate to the PETSc team via the mailing lists
<mailto:petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov> and <mailto:petsc-users@mcs.anl.gov>, [PETSc on Discord](https://discord.gg/Fqm8r6Gcyb), and with
[PETSc GitLab Issues](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/issues). When responding there,
please follow these guidelines:

- Be polite and behave according to the [Code of Conduct](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Address the person by name (when you can determine a name).
- Apologize for the problem when it is appropriate.
- Thank the person for their patience if it is more than six hours since the report came in.
- If the person drops "petsc-maint" or "petsc-users" from the reply list, add it back.
- Donâ€™t ask too many questions or give too many suggestions in the same email. The user often responds only to the first of them or becomes confused.
