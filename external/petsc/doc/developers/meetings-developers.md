# Meeting organization practices

This highlights some of the organizational practices of previous PETSc meetings.

- Collecting registration fees.
  - In 2023 we used EventBright, Barry set it up and had the money go straight to his bank account. For nontrivial amounts of
    money this can produce tax issues since EventBright sends the information to the IRS.
  - In 2025 NumFocus set up a Tito account to receive the registration fees. However since they don't know about PETSc meetings
    Barry had to spend as much time as he did with EventBright organizing the webpages.

- Collecting abstracts for presentations/posters
  - In 2023 and 2025 Junchao Zhang set up a Google form to receive abstracts since neither EventBright or Tito support users
    uploading materials. It is annoying to have two registration processes, one for money and one for abstracts. It would be
    best if this could be simplified.

- Remember to **take a group photograph** during the meeting.
