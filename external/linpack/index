#	Netlib Index for LINPACK
#
#	NOTE:
#	1.  Entries are arranged in alphabetical order by the real routine name.
#	(If you are looking for a specific complex Hermitian routine, you
#	will find it listed with its real symmetric equivalent.)
#	2.  Specifications for pairs of real and complex routines have been
#	merged.  In a few cases, specifications of three routines have been
#	merged, one for real symmetric, one for complex symmetric, and one
#	for complex Hermitian matrices.
#	3.  Specifications are given only for single precision routines.  To
#	adapt them for the double precision version of the software, simply
#	interpret REAL as DOUBLE PRECISION and COMPLEX and COMPLEX*16 (or
#	DOUBLE COMPLEX).
