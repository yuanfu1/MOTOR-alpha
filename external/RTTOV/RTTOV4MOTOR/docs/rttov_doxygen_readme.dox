@section Introduction

RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS) is a fast radiative transfer model originally developed at ECMWF in the early
90's (Eyre, 1991). Subsequently the original code has gone through several developments (e.g. Saunders
et al., 1999; Matricardi et al., 2001; Saunders et al., 2018), more recently within the EUMETSAT NWP Satellite
Application Facility (SAF), of which RTTOV v13 is the latest version. The model allows rapid simulations (~1 ms
for 40 channel ATOVS on a desktop PC) of radiances for satellite visible, infrared and microwave nadir scanning 
radiometers given an atmospheric profile of temperature, variable gas concentrations, cloud and surface properties,
referred to as the state vector.
