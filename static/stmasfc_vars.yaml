# numvars         Number of analysis variables;
# varnames        The names of these analysis variables, following the
#                 convention of the netcdf for surface analysis (LAPS);
#                 In order to run a multi-variate analysis, users have
#                 to arrange their variable names as USF,VSF,PSF,TSF;
# radius          Influence radius of observations in each directions.
#                 Each variable has different radius in x,y,t,z, and land as
#                 topography and land-water are considered (meters, seconds);
# smooth          parameters for smoothing 2 delta x waves
# inc             increment sizes for controling how obs mapped to grid following bkgd patterns;
# thresholds      Threshold values for rejecting obs that has larger difference
#                 from background than the thresholds.
# stddev          Factors of standard deviations for rejecting observation data
